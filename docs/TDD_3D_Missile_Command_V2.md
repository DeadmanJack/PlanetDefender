- **Spatial Partitioning:** Quad-tree for efficient collision detection

#### Object Pooling System
```
Pool Manager:
- Pre-allocated pools for missiles, projectiles, enemies, and effects
- Dynamic pool sizing based on performance metrics
- Automatic cleanup and recycling of inactive objects
- Memory-efficient object lifecycle management
- Pool categories: Missiles (1000+), Projectiles (500+), Enemies (200+), Effects (300+)
```

#### Mass AI System
```
AI Architecture:
- Mass AI framework for large-scale entity management
- Behavior Trees for complex enemy decision making
- Shared AI knowledge base for coordinated behaviors
- Performance-optimized AI updates with distance-based LOD
- AI archetypes: Basic Missile, Smart Missile, Cluster Missile, Boss Missile
```

### 2. User Interface
```
UI Architecture:
- HUD (health bars, resource counters, minimap)
- Supply Drop Interface (upgrade selection with bullet time)
- Strategic View (tactical overlay for commander abilities)
- Meta-Progression Menu (between-session upgrades)
```

### 3. Audio System
- **Wwise Integration:** Dynamic audio mixing
- **3D Spatial Audio:** Positional sound for explosions, weapons

- Settings (graphics, audio, controls)
```

## Key Technical Challenges

### 1. Scalability
- **Entity Count:** Support 1000+ simultaneous entities
- **Weapon Systems:** Multiple automated weapons with independent targeting
- **Visual Effects:** Maintain performance with complex particle systems

### 2. Real-Time Responsiveness
