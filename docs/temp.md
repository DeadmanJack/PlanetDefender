While a specific Unreal Engine 5.6 has not been officially released, based on the existing documentation and structure of Unreal Engine 5, you can retrieve platform and memory information using a combination of C++ functions and console commands.

### Getting Platform Information

To obtain information about the platform your game is running on, you can utilize the `FPlatformMisc` class and its platform-specific implementations. For a more straightforward approach to get the platform name, `UGameplayStatics` is recommended.

A primary class for platform-specific functionality is `FPlatformMisc`. While many of its functions are geared towards platform-level operations like handling files or processes, it also provides methods to query hardware and platform details. Be aware that some `FPlatformMisc` functions may point to platform-specific implementations like `FWindowsPlatformMisc` on Windows.

For a simple way to get the name of the current platform as a string (e.g., "Windows", "Mac", "Linux", "IOS", "Android"), you can use the `GetPlatformName` function from the `UGameplayStatics` class. This is particularly useful for implementing platform-specific logic in your game.

### Getting Memory Information

For detailed memory usage statistics, Unreal Engine provides the `FPlatformMemory` class and the `FGenericPlatformMemoryStats` struct. For real-time memory analysis, you can also leverage built-in console commands.

The `FGenericPlatformMemoryStats` struct is designed to hold a variety of common memory statistics for all platforms. It can provide information such as:
*   Available physical and virtual memory.
*   Peak physical and virtual memory used by the process.
*   Physical and virtual memory currently used by the process.

You can populate this structure using functions within the `FPlatformMemory` class.

For quick, real-time memory checks within the editor or a development build, you can use the `stat MemoryPlatform` console command. This command displays a summary of the memory usage on the current platform. For a more detailed report, the `memreport -full` command can be used.

For in-depth memory analysis, Unreal Engine 5 offers the **Memory Insights** tool. This tool provides a detailed breakdown of memory allocation and deallocation, helping to identify memory leaks and optimize memory usage.

Here's an example of how you might use some of these functions in your C++ code:

```cpp
#include "Kismet/GameplayStatics.h"
#include "GenericPlatform/GenericPlatformMemory.h"
#include "HAL/PlatformMisc.h"

void AMyActor::GetPlatformAndMemoryInfo()
{
    // Get Platform Name
    FString PlatformName = UGameplayStatics::GetPlatformName();
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Platform: %s"), *PlatformName);

    // Get Memory Stats
    FPlatformMemoryStats MemoryStats = FPlatformMemory::GetStats();
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Available Physical Memory: %llu bytes"), MemoryStats.AvailablePhysical);
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Used Physical Memory: %llu bytes"), MemoryStats.UsedPhysical);
}
```


Yes, Unreal Engine provides more detailed information about the platform's hardware and software through various C++ classes. While `UGameplayStatics::GetPlatformName()` gives you a general platform identifier, you can delve deeper to get specifics about the CPU, GPU, and operating system.

### Detailed Hardware Information with `FPlatformMisc`

The primary class for this is `FPlatformMisc`, which has platform-specific implementations (e.g., `FWindowsPlatformMisc`, `FApplePlatformMisc`). This class offers a range of functions to query hardware details.

Here's how you can get more specific information:

#### CPU Information

You can retrieve detailed information about the CPU, such as its brand, vendor, and the number of cores.

*   **`FPlatformMisc::GetCPUBrand()`**: Returns the full brand string of the CPU (e.g., "Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9700K CPU @ 3.60GHz").
*   **`FPlatformMisc::GetCPUVendor()`**: Returns the vendor of the CPU (e.g., "GenuineIntel").
*   **`FPlatformMisc::NumberOfCores()`**: Gives you the total number of physical cores on the system.
*   **`FPlatformMisc::NumberOfCoresIncludingHyperthreads()`**: Provides the number of logical cores, including hyper-threaded ones.
*   **`FPlatformMisc::GetCPUInfo()`**: Retrieves a bitfield with detailed CPU signature information like stepping, model, and family.

#### GPU Information

You can also get information about the graphics card and its driver.

*   **`FPlatformMisc::GetPrimaryGPUBrand()`**: Returns the brand of the primary GPU.
*   The `FGPUAdpater` and `FGPUDriverInfo` structs can provide more in-depth details about the GPU adapter and its driver.

#### Example C++ Code Snippet:

```cpp
#include "HAL/PlatformMisc.h"

void AMyActor::LogDetailedPlatformInfo()
{
    // CPU Information
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("CPU Brand: %s"), *FPlatformMisc::GetCPUBrand());
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("CPU Vendor: %s"), *FPlatformMisc::GetCPUVendor());
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("Number of Cores: %d"), FPlatformMisc::NumberOfCores());
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("Number of Logical Cores: %d"), FPlatformMisc::NumberOfCoresIncludingHyperthreads());

    // GPU Information
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("Primary GPU Brand: %s"), *FPlatformMisc::GetPrimaryGPUBrand());
}
```

Asked:  is there a platform info or anthing that gives more information about the platform?


### Hardware Survey

For a more comprehensive, though asynchronous, collection of hardware data, you can use the `IHardwareSurvey` module. This can gather a wide range of information similar to what the Epic Games Launcher hardware survey collects.

### Device Profiles

Unreal Engine uses **Device Profiles** to manage scalability and settings for different hardware configurations, particularly on mobile platforms. You can use these profiles to apply different settings for textures, rendering features, and more based on the device's capabilities.

You can access the currently active device profile in C++ to make decisions based on the hardware's performance bracket (e.g., low, mid, high-end Android devices).

### Operating System and Other Information

`FPlatformMisc` also provides functions for other system information:

*   **`FPlatformMisc::GetOSVersion()`**: Gets the version of the operating system.
*   **`FPlatformMisc::GetOSCommandLine()`**: Retrieves the command line used to launch the application.
*   **`FPlatformMisc::GetEnvironmentVariable()`**: Allows you to read the value of a system environment variable.
*   **`FPlatformMisc::IsRunningOnBattery()`**: Checks if the device is currently running on battery power.

By using these more specific functions, you can get a much more granular view of the platform your game is running on and tailor the user experience accordingly.
