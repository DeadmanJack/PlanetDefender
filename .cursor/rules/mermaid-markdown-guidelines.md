# Mermaid and Markdown Guidelines

## Primary Reference
**ALWAYS check `docs/mermaid_and_markdown_guide.md` first** for guidance on mermaid diagrams and markdown formatting. This document contains tested examples and solutions for common markdown rendering issues across different IDEs.

## Key Guidelines
- **Reference the guide first**: Before creating any mermaid diagrams, check the guide for working examples
- **Test rendering**: Markdown can be flaky with graphs on different IDEs - use proven patterns from the guide
- **Use established patterns**: The guide contains tested mermaid syntax that works across different environments
- **Extend the guide**: Add new working examples to the guide as they are discovered

## Common Issues to Avoid
- Don't assume mermaid syntax will render correctly without testing
- Don't use complex mermaid features without verifying they work in the target IDE
- Don't create markdown that might break in different preview environments
- Don't ignore the guide's examples when creating similar diagrams

## When Creating Diagrams
1. **Check the guide first** for similar diagram types
2. **Use proven syntax** from the guide's working examples
3. **Test rendering** in the target environment
4. **Add successful examples** to the guide for future reference
5. **Keep diagrams simple** when possible to avoid rendering issues

## Guide Maintenance
- The guide should be updated with new working examples
- Failed rendering attempts should be documented with solutions
- IDE-specific quirks should be noted in the guide
- Complex diagrams should be broken down into simpler components when possible

## File Location
