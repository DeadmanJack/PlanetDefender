Try this:
nope, i never retarget.. i just assigned the TPS skeleton to my character mesh
https://youtu.be/ob4lBgsfC00 @JSFILMZ  helped me out just assign the skeleton to the default mannequin and then make that compatible with the tps kit skeleton 

Retarget anims:
1) open /Content/AdvancedLocomotionV4/CharacterAssets/MannequinSkeleton/ALS_Mannequin_Skeleton.uasset
2) Window -> Asset Details
3) Add compatible skeleton from new animation package
4) Select Asset Browswer tab and make sure new anims show up
5) Open /Content/Synty/IKRetargeter_ALS_to_Synty.uasset
6) Select new anims in Asset Browser tab
7) Click "Export Selected Animations" button and save them into a folder
	7b) I usually name the folder RTG_Anims and put it in the new anim asset package folder where it makes sense
8) You should now be able to open /Content/Synty/SK_Synty_Polygon_Unreal.uasset and play the new anims
9) File -> Save All

---- Live Coding ----
https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/using-live-coding-to-recompile-unreal-engine-applications-at-runtime/
IMPORTANT:  Leave "Enable Reinstancing" checked when using live coding.  Not doing so can corrupt things.  Also, need to occasionally run
== When Object Reinstancing is enabled, you need to clean up pointers. If your code maintains pointers to objects that can be reinstanced, you need to use "ReloadReinstancingCompleteDelegate" and "ReloadCompleteDelegate" to update these pointers or invalidate caches so they can be repopulated later.

To Do:
